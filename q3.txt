Yes, definitely. It is a place that is very nice, comfortable, cozy, accepting, understanding, and well..unlike how a normal high school feels. I went there for help on my personal problems, and Mr. Grey definitely helped me so much to get back on track and keep focusing on my classes. Now that I look back, simply the passion that this man strives to improve everyone that comes to him is enough reason to keep the care center going. He is simply so passionate, truthful, and caring. I think he is the best part of the care center haha. It would most certainly be a tragedy if we closed the care center and lost Mr. Grey.

YES! It gives the students a safe place to resort to when they’re going through difficult times. The Care Center has welcomed so many students with open arms and genuinely changed the lives of our poly kids.
3/3/2018 2:16 PM
Yes! It is such a great source for people who need to talk to someone and who are going through a hard time. The care center has helped so many of my friends.
2/28/2018 6:17 PM
Yes, the care scented is very important. So many people have nobody to speak to about their feelings. The care center to some people is their only outlet. We’ve already had on suicide last year. Imagine how many people will take their lives once they lost their voice.
2/28/2018 11:09 AM
Yes I think it provide some a safe environment to deal with personal stress form school and personal issues that is very benifiscal to all of poly's students
2/28/2018 2:30 AM
I think it is because I think it’s important for students to talk to someone and feel welcome someplace other than home.
2/28/2018 1:56 AM
Despite having never been there, I believe the care center is important as it helps individuals who are having emotional or other personal issues. Without the care center, I believe these kids could maybe never recover and be bitter for years. Worse yet, they could reach a breaking point and harm someone or themselves.
2/28/2018 12:35 AM
It is important because it allows kids to feel comfortable in a space where they won’t be judged and are allowed to share anything that is bothering them.
2/28/2018 12:22 AM
It is so important!! I have heard of countless amounts of instances where mental health has made someone do something terrible. How can we try to stop this if we do not have resources to help students?
2/27/2018 11:57 PM
I may have not been their befoe but it has helped my friends various of times to help them on their lives
2/27/2018 11:52 PM
Yes! Although I have never been, it is reassuring to have a place to go when I am emotionally unstable. My friends have recieved care and support from the center and we are greatful that it exists. Please, let’s keep the care center!
2/27/2018 11:34 PM
I think the Care Center is extremely important for the mental health of all the students at our school. Even though I have never had any particular reason to go there yet, just knowing that it is available for me as an outlet/escape alleviates stress and makes my school experience easier and more comfortable. The Care Center is important as a resource for the maintenance of mental peace and stability.
2/27/2018 11:31 PM
the care center helps people feel comfortable and safe, also to help you make new friends and feel more confident.
2/27/2018 10:48 PM
We've lost too many students to mental health. This is a safe place needed for students who are struggling.
2/27/2018 10:10 PM
Yes, High school is the most difficult time of any kids life and it is so important to have a safe place to go and talk to someone and recover. If students are having problems what are they supposed to do?? In reality all the academic counselors are so busy constantly what if a kid is really having and issue and he goes to his counselors office and they’re not there, because they are out watching kids in the quad or speaking to English classes, that kid is lost. After Emi last year the Care Center was a haven for so many people and the peer counselors there and Mr. Gray really made a difference and helped students affected really heal. We can’t lose more kids bc their well-being wasn’t in the budget.
2/27/2018 10:08 PM
Yes! It provides vital support to those who are most in need on Poly’s campus.
2/27/2018 9:52 PM
Yes as it lets people relieve pain and stress through communication
2/27/2018 9:52 PM
I think it is important to have a safe place on campus for students who may not have anyone to go to or just anyone in general so we can go there and be comfortable to know that our feelings or issues will be heard and that SOMEONE is always there to help. If we get rid of this we are getting rid of that support we need at Poly!
2/27/2018 9:29 PM
Yes I do because it helps people with personal issues
2/27/2018 9:27 PM
It gives students, with problems, that they can’t tell others, a chance to have someone to talk to that WILL listen.
2/27/2018 9:24 PM
Yes, because life is hard, and its nice to know that if I needed someone, there will be someone at the care center for me
2/27/2018 9:20 PM
The Care Center’s is beyond important because Mr.Gray and his student councilors have helped so many students with issues who we have No oneness else to go to but they listen, and they care for us poly students.
2/27/2018 9:13 PM
The care center is one of the most important tools that Poly offers! Think about how many students they have helped in a dark time in their lives. The care center give has offered light during unfortunate times for people! The care center is what makes people feel like someone is always there no matter what. The care center should not be closed, the care center is sometimes the only source that people have to rely on. The care center is what sets Poly apart from other schools, it truly does show that someone is always there to help us survive the craziness of high school. The care center needs to stay open.
2/27/2018 8:59 PM
Where do I begin...in high school a million things get thrown at you at once, but if your emotions can’t even hold together, everything else falls apart. The CARE center is a place where students can work through life, whether it’s the death of a family member, divorce, unhealthy relationships, or any other similar thing, so that they can keep doing whatever it is they need to be doing, including studying
2/27/2018 8:32 PM
yes
2/27/2018 8:29 PM
Yes! Every school needs a a little safe haven when life gets a little rough. Not everyone has that teacher they can rely on to let them cool off a bit, and the care center is SO important to the mental health of students. Life can get stressful with school, work, friends, and family and no problem is too small for the care center. People are able to go and relax and talk it out with someone. It also gives the option for self care, which is so important to learn how to do at a young age.
2/27/2018 8:20 PM
It's a good place for people to go when they don't feel good physically, emotionally, mentally or if they need a break from school. Mr. Gray is very easy to talk to and sweet, very informative, and can make your day better. He's helped so many people and that center itself has been there for so many people for so many different things it would be a shame to get rid of it; it's one thing at poly you simply can't replace or take away.
2/27/2018 8:16 PM
Yes because people as in teenagers sometimes don’t have the confidence to talk to most adults or other people but in the care center we have the confidence to talk about the issues we have and the problems in which others tend to ignore.
2/27/2018 8:04 PM
Yes it is. It’s gotten me through some pretty hard times and helped me feel better when I needed it
2/27/2018 8:03 PM
Mental health is so important, especially to teenagers who are often more mentally vulnerable, and it's a very good resource to have.
2/27/2018 7:52 PM
i think the care center has become increasingly important today, especially with recent events such as mass shootings at schools becoming more common. i believe that the care center should remain in place because many need the support, whether it be concerning mental health disorders, school stress or to cope with disasters outside of our control.
2/27/2018 7:49 PM
It provides a safe and nonjudgemental environment for students to go when they feel overwhelmed and need help.
2/27/2018 7:18 PM
The CARE Center provides a valuable mental health resource for students who are otherwise unable to access it. The following list is not exhaustive, but include some of the reasons a student may need to use the CARE Center: the student's household may be unable to afford counseling; the student may be living in an emotionally abusive or neglectful household; the student's primary caretakers do not "believe in" mental illness and refuse to pay for treatment.
2/27/2018 7:06 PM
It is important because it allows people to have a place where they can go to when the are having trouble or problems. It is a place where people can go to talk to another person and feel better . It is a place where you feel that you aren’t alone because of the help and support they give you .
2/27/2018 7:02 PM
The care center allows students to speak to peers without the fear of speaking to an adult. It allows students to be heard and feel heard. Students use this place to destress and talk about their problems. I went to the care as a freshman and sophomore to cope with family problems and spoke about my depression. It made me feel, someone was there to listen. It was great to speak to a peer who was around my age to speak to because they can understand well what I go through. We lost a few students along the years as poly and we set up a place in the library for students to grieve. Peer counselors were able to help students grieve, during that time. I find it empowering and beneficial, the care center set up a place for students to grieve and allow students to talk to peer counselors during that time.
2/27/2018 7:01 PM
Provides a voice for your thoughts and feelings to be heard and be valid. Also, provides a safe place for all students.
2/27/2018 6:55 PM
Absolutely. It dramatically improved the quality of my friends’ lives and I’m not sure they would still be here without it. They didn’t have the support they needed at home so they needed to seek it elsewhere, and the CARE center provided them with what they needed.
2/27/2018 6:49 PM
Several of my best friends would have taken their own lives without the care center. Several of my friends would have not gotten into college or out of abusive situations without the care center. The thought of getting rid of the care center at poly is absolutely fucking ridiculous. My own sisters would likely have self harmed or even committed suicide without the care center. Think of the students, not the money.
2/27/2018 6:46 PM
The Care Center is a crucial part of the Poly community. In an environment that is so fast-paced like Poly, a center that allows students to take care of their mental health is a priceless addition to the school.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
yes because it helps students deal with stress and problems. also especially with the recent events happening, we need the care center to spread positivity and help people talk about their problems to fellow peers. many students have gone to the care center and it has helped each of them cope with whatever they’re going through.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
The CARE Center is an integral part of the Poly community. At the CARE Center, you always know that someone is there for you to help you deal with anything you might be going through, whether it be school related, a family issue, or dispute with friends. The CARE center strengthens the sense of belonging and family that is at the heart of our school.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
Yes, because most of the school goes there to talk to someone when they need to
2/27/2018 6:41 PM
The care center is important for people’s well beings. You don’t know what anyone can be going through; but for someone to talk to another person about their well being can help them more than just enough. And that being taken away is a big mistake.
2/27/2018 6:30 PM
I think it has helped so many kids. both the people who visit the care center and also the people who were peer counselors. some kids find it helpful to talk to a kid their age rather than an adult.
2/27/2018 6:29 PM
It is important because I feel that students should have someone there to talk to all the time regarding any issues they have. Mental health is very important for an adolescent & we should make a priority to make kids feel stable with their mental health so they can perform better in school.
2/27/2018 6:23 PM
Yes because it greatly helps people go through troubling times
2/27/2018 6:07 PM
Yes I do believe the Care Center is important though I have never been to it because I view it almost as a last resort for myself. If the people, including staff and close friends, that I would normally go to for advice are not available I know there’s a place I could go to for help. It is reassuring knowing that I’ll always have some place to go if I ever need help.
2/27/2018 6:06 PM
It made me feel better about my friends mental health
2/27/2018 5:45 PM
The care center is important. Sometimes school and life becomes too overwhelming. The care center gives us a place where we can feel recieve help, open up about our problems. It’s a saving grace on this campus.
2/27/2018 5:45 PM
Yes, it provides a safe space for students to talk to mentors
2/27/2018 5:43 PM
It really focuses in on those who may not feel like their voice isn’t heard anywhere else and especially with the recent shooting, it’s able to shed some more light on mental emotional aspects and help people cope in a healthier manner.
2/27/2018 5:31 PM
It is an essential service that these students and the Long Beach Poly community needs. Without the CARE center a lot of kids would have no place where they could feel safe to share all the trauma they may be experiencing in life. My friend Emilio passed away last year, and it was absolutely devastating. Without the CARE center more students may feel isolated without a single person to tell about what they are going through. They need Mr. Gray and the CARE center. Taking away this resource is absolutely unacceptable.
2/27/2018 5:12 PM
students need a place where they can feel better ESPECIALLY if they cannot feel comfortable at home
2/27/2018 4:58 PM
YES! Many students visit the care center everyday, they feel safe here.
2/27/2018 4:55 PM
I think it’s important to have a place like the care center as a recourse for students who may not have another safe space like it.
2/27/2018 4:51 PM
It give people the can to de-stress about the situation that they are in even if it is only temporary and it also help me find alternative solutions to the problems that I had to face
2/27/2018 4:50 PM
Yes, it is important. Students’ mental health should be the top priority at poly.
2/27/2018 4:45 PM
Yes because it helps many people with their problems
2/27/2018 4:38 PM
yes, because it is very resourceful and many of my friends have gone there seeking for help emotionally and just in general.
2/27/2018 4:37 PM
Yes, it is an extremely important mental health service, and is an excellent resource for kids who need the help they need (that they might not otherwise get at home). In the wake of recent events, the topic of mental health has become a topic of discussion. Taking care of mental health early on is so important in creating a healthy student population, and is a good step in preventing school shootings by mental illnesses that weren’t taken care of from happening. The CARE center is imperative to helping out the kids that need it. The youth more than ever have high rates of mental illness, often in conjunction as depression and anxiety. Without fostering centers to help students cope with these dehabilitating mental illnesses, students will turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms and violence early on. In short, the CARE center is integral to maintaining a healthy student population and is an incredibly valuable resource for those who need the help.
2/27/2018 4:34 PM
Very much so, mental health is a problem for many high school students and having a program as accessible as the care center is a great thing to have. Accessibility is a major factor when it comes to needing help with anything.
2/27/2018 4:19 PM
It helps people who are dealing with problems and need assistance from a similar aged student get help. One time my friend was getting threatened by another student and went to the care center for mental support and they dealt with the problem in assistance with administration.
2/27/2018 4:14 PM
Yes!! Because it helps those who don’t know where to turn to and has helped my friends turn away from choices such as suicide
2/27/2018 4:09 PM
Yes, it is a helpful and easily accessible service for students to use and benefit from
2/27/2018 4:06 PM
Yes, I think it's very important. It's a safe place for many on a large campus if life becomes overwhelming
2/27/2018 4:06 PM
I hear great things about it from other people and I know how important it was to people last year when our school was facing a horrible time.
2/27/2018 4:05 PM
I think the Care Center is incredibly important because it allows people to surround themselves in a safe environment outside of their homes. The work that the Care Center has provided is impeccable. It provides peer guidance and allows one to seek adult assistance at ease. This safe place will aid to alleviate depression, anxiety, or any other issues involving the lives of teens at Poly. High School is a stressful time for a lot of people, and providing an outlet of comfort and distress is what helps many get through these difficult times. So how is it, that the funding of an environment that can prohibit bullying, depression, and excess stress is lacking to the point of becoming obsolete. If that isn’t important...if relieving someone from suicidal thoughts, anxiety disorders, and other issues teens encounter over the 4 year course of their life before adulthood isn’t important...then I’m not sure what is.
2/27/2018 4:04 PM
Yes it’s essential just like how having a nurse is essential for a school so is the care center for mental health.
2/27/2018 3:56 PM
The care center is very important. It gives the students a chance to go to a safe place and work through problems. It has prevented suicides as well.
2/27/2018 3:56 PM
I think it is important because it is necessary for people that have no one to express themselves to
2/27/2018 3:53 PM
An important place for emotional teens to express their feelings, and discover therapeutic techniques to cope with their life dilemmas
2/27/2018 3:53 PM
Yes. It saves lives and will continue to do so.
2/27/2018 3:50 PM
The Care Center provides a safe place for students with anxiety problems to go when they cannot attend class, something anyone with anxiety will tell you is vital to their symptoms not getting worse. Additionally the peer and adult counseling provides at the Care Center helps many many students with family and personal issues and has personally helped myself seek help from an abusive situation as well as get me the help I need with actual therapy outside of school. I feel like the Care Center is one of those things that is, sadly, unique to Poly but should be a nationwide normality for it helps so many students with such a range of issues, some of which I myself cannot begin to imagine. The guidance I have received at the Care Center has helped me get to a safer place in my home life and a better mental state. If it weren’t for the Care Center I would not have had the resources needed to back me mentally, and therefore I would not be the straight A student I am able to be today.
2/27/2018 3:18 PM
Yes. I've been lucky to have had no serious issues in my life but I have friends who feel the center is like their second home. I think what the care center stands for is great and I would definitely visit the room if I needed help or just someone to talk to.
2/27/2018 2:26 PM
Yes, it gives a place to those who have no where to go when they need someone to talk to. It is a comforting place to let everything out.
2/27/2018 2:22 PM
Yes because it helps students vent and be able to talk to people.
2/27/2018 2:20 PM
Yes, it is important because students need a place to go to if they feel overwhelmed and can't handle class.
2/27/2018 2:15 PM
Yes, aome sturdents don't have a place that feels safe to them. The Care Center is a place where they can release what they are holding it because sometimes we can't go to other centers in the community and our homes don't feel as safe.
2/27/2018 1:48 PM
Very important, it's a safe space
2/27/2018 1:43 PM
it is important to the students and for poly since there are many students with various problems and it can affect each of them differently and especially affects their academic performances. care center has love and removing it means poly is missing a piece of heart that is needed. i would’ve never been able to get help if there was no care center
2/27/2018 1:14 PM
I’ve seen the effects of peer counselors on my friends and it’s been nothing but good for them. When my friends who suffer from anxiety aren’t feeling well, they can go to the care center and they exit with a little more peace and sanity. Last year when Emi killed himself, everyone who needed help went to the care center and I felt our school heal day by day. With the threat of school shootings more avid now than ever, the last thing we need is to get rid of the care center. The mental heath of myself and my peers is important for the safety of our school.
2/27/2018 1:02 PM
It helps people through a really tough time in their lives: high school. I think the care center is a really crucial part of poly and shows poly’s desire to help students with their issues, it shows poly cares about its students.
2/27/2018 12:32 PM
I believe that many people can go there when they are in need of help or just need someone to talk to. It’s a really important and necessary resource that we high schoolers need. It could save someoneones life and having someone there to talk to makes all the difference in the world.
2/27/2018 12:19 PM
The Care Center is important because it is a safe space for teenagers where they can discuss their feelings, anxieties, and struggles. It is such a blessing to have because with all of these tragedies occurring, teenagers need this place to help to get guidance. The Care Center is vital to help out anybody who needs it, and it is a place where they don’t feel ashamed to go to.
2/27/2018 12:17 PM
I think the care center offers resources and that mentally and emotionally support students in their struggles in school. Life can be stressful and it's important to have a safe place to go to.
2/27/2018 12:15 PM
Yes students need someone to talk to since everyone has their own problems and the care center does a great job at it
2/27/2018 12:14 PM
Yes it helps the students when detestation occured. During the suicide of a student in the fall 2017 , the care center was flooded with students
2/27/2018 12:05 PM
Yes, because it provides a place for stidents to go if they have any issues that are not academic, but equally, if not more, important.
2/27/2018 11:44 AM

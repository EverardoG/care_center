Well, my best friend and I were going through some rough times. This person was suddenly ghosting me, and I took it very hard. It was especially challenging because this person sat around me in many classes, so I would always uncontrollably think of them in the classes and unconsciously tune out the teacher. As a matter of fact, I almost got a B my second semester because of this, but through the help of my friends and the career center, got back on track right at the end of the semester and grabbed my A back.

At some of the toughest times Poly had to endure as a family, the care center gave us a comforting place to vent.

It’s helped my sister all throughout high school.

One time, I was considering suicide. I even packed up all my things and bought the rope. One of my friends knew I was going through a hard time af convinced me to go to the care center. I was a little hesitant at first, but I eventually went and it was the best choice I have ever made. Mr. Gray and all the peer consolers were so welcoming and accepting, I felt at home. I’m alive because of them today, I am forever greatful.

It has helped me so much. I had a panic attack at school once where I physically could not be in class because my anxiety was too high. The care center helped me to feel better so I could resume classes for the rest of the day after that period.

They have helped my friend get over stress
2/27/2018 11:52 PM
Although I have never been because I have been lucky enough to remain emotionally stable so far, just knowing that you have people to support and care for you gives me and others reasons to continue trying hard at school and in life. The care center provides so much support to the student body, and taking it away will do more harm than good.

The Care Center has helped alleviate discomfort and stress by simply being open as resouce. Knowing that it’s open for me and for my friends is comforting enough and has helped me in that way.
2/27/2018 11:31 PM
Not personally but I know it has helped many of my friends.

2/27/2018 9:52 PM
ive had multiple friend go to the care center for numberous things such as self harm or even sexual assault and they have always helped them through it it was the right place to go
2/27/2018 9:29 PM
No
2/27/2018 9:27 PM
Talking to me, listening to me.. something that no one else has done before.
2/27/2018 9:13 PM
It helped me learn how to process and verbalize my emotions
2/27/2018 8:32 PM
It serves as a safe place for me to go when I can’t seem to wrap my head around life. Even though for me it’s school stresses, but they never feel like my problems don’t mean anything.
2/27/2018 8:20 PM
It hasn't helped me directly but I've talked to Mr.Gray before just to say hi and it really made my day better. But i know a few of my friends went in there just because but they were actually listened to and helped with and knowing that people i know personally have somewhere to go at school if nothing else, makes me feel better. If that's taken away, I honestly know why anyone would do that. It's my first year at poly and it BETTER not be the last for the care center and that's all i have to say. It's too important for poly as a whole.
2/27/2018 8:16 PM
It has in many ways not just me but my friends as well because their are issues I’ve sometimes not had the confidence to talk to but the care center helps me feel safe with talking about my issues and problems that many attempt ignore or act indifferent to my problems.
2/27/2018 8:04 PM
It’s gotten me through rough times
2/27/2018 8:03 PM
When I felt worthless and lost in life the care center was able to provide a place where I felt like I had someone to talk to. I was able to create a better mindset for myself and felt motivated to do something for my future.

I am a Poly PACE alumnus of 2016. I first visited the CARE Center in my junior year, and without it, I would almost certainly have committed suicide while enrolled at LBP. The CARE Center was somewhere I could safely express the depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation that was plaguing me and affecting my academic progress. I was unable to discuss these issues with my parents because of family problems, and I had been leaning too heavily on my friends for emotional support. The CARE Center was somewhere I could go when I was having an anxiety attack too severe to remain in class, and a wall I could "bounce" my feelings off of and work through on my own time, in my own way. The CARE Center was vital to helping me process and express my emotions in a healthy way and I owe my life to the peer counselors and Mr. G (the old one — unfortunately I have not had the pleasure of interacting with the current Mr. G).

As a freshman I was dealing with family problems, depression, and still coping over a loss of my best friend. I felt no one was there for me, not even my family. I chose to not make friends and stayed inside my cousin classroom during lunch. Nutrition I hung out with people, but I didn’t let anyone get close to me. A classmate of mine,whom I got close with told me about the care center. At first I admit I was reluctant and I tried going a few times. When I finally did, I met a peer counselor a senior at the time. He listened to my problems, comforted me, and helped me every step of the way. I felt he genuinely cared about me. I made friends with his friends and I built a close bond with people for the first time. It inspired me to become a peer counselor during my junior year, because I wanted to give back and be there for students. The care center reminded me, I have a place to go. I have a place to feel safe and be myself. Even as a peer counselor, I wanted to make students feel safe, comfortable, and allow them to be themselves. The care center is extremely beneficial to high school students, it allows students to vent about their problems. Sometimes students just cry or have an anxiety attack. Students will have a place to cry or calm down from an anxiety attack or panic attack. In a safe place.

N/A, but please reconsider the decision to defund it. Its value may not be immediately obvious but it has improved and saved countless lives.
2/27/2018 6:49 PM
They’ve helped me by helping my friends. Without it, god knows what would’ve happened to them or if they’d still be alive today. They helped my sisters not commit suicide
2/27/2018 6:46 PM
The Care Center has helped me so many times during my time at Poly. Throughout my 4 years at Poly, 3 of my friends passed away and although the entire school was also mourning their passing I (for lack of a better and un-cliche phrase) felt myself losing myself in grief. The Care Center was one of the only places that I was able to express myself and have someone listen to me during the whole situation. When Jesse Yuth passed away, the Care center was the one place that allowed me to mourn and understood my needs. When Emilio passed, the Care center was there. When Shawn Lim passed, the Care center was available. To get rid of this would not only be a tremendous tragedy but it would negatively affect the mental health of the very students that the school is responsible for.

personally i havent gone to the care center but it has helped many of my friends and many of the students at poly. being able to talk to other people and knowing that they will listen is so important in dealing with our problems and taking it away in a way can make people feel as if they have no one to talk to and no where to go that will be safe and confidential.

In my sophomore year, I received a C on a test that I had studied very hard for in a class that I had been struggling in. A friend of mine noticed that I was upset and walked me over to the CARE center where I was able to talk to Mr. Gray and a peer counselor. It gave me a space to calm and compose myself before going to my next class. It was nice feeling that there was someone on my side when I needed it.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
I haven’t used it but my friends have and it helped them.
2/27/2018 6:41 PM
The care center has helped me not doing strenuous things to myself. I’ve visited multiple times in times of stressed and in times of hardship and going to the care center has helped my mental health greatly just because someone was there to listen to me.
2/27/2018 6:30 PM
It hasn’t helped me personally but it has helped my peers
2/27/2018 6:23 PM
Getting rid of the Care Center in light of was has been happening lately is a good way of showing where the priorities of schools are. Before that gun threat I’ve always felt safe at school. But it made me realize that what has happened to 18 schools this past year can happen to my own. Not only does taking the Care Center take help away from me, and it also takes the potential help from my peers; that’s why it is not okay.
2/27/2018 6:06 PM
I am not willing, to personal
2/27/2018 5:45 PM
My mother had a medical emergency at 4 in the morning one day before I came to school. At school I continuously replayed the incident in my head, causing me to feel helpless. Luckily, I found the help I needed at the care center.
2/27/2018 5:45 PM
It gave me a place to feel safe and welcome when I was dealing with the deaths of two friends. When I experienced suicidal thoughts and anxiety I went to the CARE center and they subsided.
2/27/2018 5:12 PM
the care center helped me when i was too scared to tell anyone my problems without feeling judged and telling Mr. Gray was a good idea since i feel better when my parents did not believe me having anxiety and other mental health issue. i was saved by mr. gray and his openness to listen to my emotions and feelings. now i feel way better living without worries
2/27/2018 4:58 PM
The care center helped me feel more comfortable around my peers. I was able to create friendships with a lot of new people.
2/27/2018 4:55 PM
I haven’t been, sorry.
2/27/2018 4:51 PM
My mom just passed away and I felt as if my whole world was falling apart because I had no other "family" I didn't have a dad or any relatives that could help their all in New York however when I was sad or when I busted into tear and people brought me to the Care Center they didn't judge or hassle me about anything that I was going through they just welcomed me with open arms One thing I learned was it's okay to be sad and it takes time in other words it allowed me to feel relief for the first time since I had to be strong in front of my sister so I'm grateful for the Care Center because when I was in a bad financial crisis they helped me look up alternative solutions to the problem and for that I truly felt that I wasn't alone

Mr. Gray is so understanding and very available.

I have never been there personally.
2/27/2018 3:56 PM
I have never used the care center, but never have i been afraid to visit, i have always been aware of its existence and am willing to go whenever my lifes occursnces permits it
2/27/2018 3:53 PM
Please feel free to read my answer to question 3 and/or 4. I feel I’ve answered this question in those two sections already.
2/27/2018 3:18 PM
The center has given me a better understanding of the struggles my peers and have learned how to give good advice and support.
2/27/2018 2:26 PM
The care center needs to stay at Poly, the students as well as Mr. Gray have been there for many of my classmates and I don’t see why it should be taken away.
2/27/2018 2:22 PM
I was able to rant to someone and not be judged and i was listened to
2/27/2018 2:20 PM
The Care Center has helped me by being another source of support. Sometimes family and a group of friends don't understand what you're going through, and the Care Center doesn't judge and helps you get through it.
2/27/2018 1:48 PM
I would like to, but i'm not sure what to write
2/27/2018 1:43 PM
it helped me by reaching out for further help when i couldn’t talk to anyone because of security reasons
2/27/2018 1:14 PM
I had really bad anxiety and mr. Gray helped me by talking to me and being calm and helping be be calm and rational. I felt supported and a little more confident. I think the care center is really important because therapy is expensive and it’s really nice to have a place at school to be supported and talk to people who care.
2/27/2018 12:32 PM
I have not had the need to visit the care center before
2/27/2018 12:19 PM
I haven't attended the care center before, but I almost did.

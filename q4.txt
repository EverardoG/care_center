Well, nothing. It’s perfect for the exact reason that it’s imperfect. It doesn’t make me want to feel like I need to be perfect or flawless to be wonderful.
3/3/2018 10:02 PM
I think the care center just had to emphasize all the qualities that they have to offer to the students.
3/3/2018 2:16 PM
Stay open!!!

2/28/2018 11:09 AM
Let people know more about how it can help them them and that uts there for thme when they need it
2/28/2018 2:30 AM
Nothing, it’s great.
2/28/2018 1:56 AM
Haven’t been there.
2/28/2018 12:35 AM
The care center could improve on being more recognized because I believe that some of peers are not aware of the valuable source that we have at school.
2/28/2018 12:22 AM
Make sure people know that this is a safe space.
2/27/2018 11:57 PM
More kids to join who can help the program grow
2/27/2018 11:52 PM
Personally, I have no idea where the care center is. Maybe clear announcements and posters showing where the center is?
2/27/2018 11:34 PM
I think that the Care Center is doing its job perfectly in providing the people of Poly High School a safe place to be heard/listened to.
2/27/2018 11:31 PM
nothing.
2/27/2018 10:48 PM
It could improve the quality of someones life
2/27/2018 10:10 PM
Mr. Gray to be there all day and it till be open through the end of the school day!!!!
2/27/2018 10:08 PM
NA
2/27/2018 9:52 PM
Maybe elaborate on what happens there and make it a little more common knowledge so I️t first seem as mysterious
2/27/2018 9:52 PM
I think it’s doing an amazing job
2/27/2018 9:29 PM
Make it more known that it exists
2/27/2018 9:27 PM
It’s perfect
2/27/2018 9:24 PM
Speeding the word that there is a care center
2/27/2018 9:20 PM
The care center is perfectly fine in my opinion, everything they have done for my friends and I has helped us with everything we couls ask for.
2/27/2018 9:13 PM
I think the care center could do a better job at advertising and getting the word out.
2/27/2018 8:59 PM
Training for peer counselors could be better, while I think it’s definitely “great”, and gets the job done, it could be “super super fantastic and awesome” instead
2/27/2018 8:32 PM
Could help students with their problems, especially if they have no one else to talk to
2/27/2018 8:29 PM
Not much, having the space alone is already a huge help to all. Possibly have the care center students come by and remind students that they are there especially during tough weeks like finals and AP season.
2/27/2018 8:20 PM
Nothing really.
2/27/2018 8:16 PM
The times in which it closes
2/27/2018 8:04 PM
If it was available all the time
2/27/2018 8:03 PM
Publicity. I'm still not entirely sure what they do entirely, do more information would be nice.
2/27/2018 7:52 PM
letting more people know that it is available and easily accessible to everyone
2/27/2018 7:49 PM
Maybe have parts of the e-book Mr. Gray created printed out so students would be able to read it at the care center whenever necessary. Or have specific videos that students can watch to motivate them and spread positivity.
2/27/2018 7:18 PM
If anything, I think the CARE Center would benefit from more staff.
2/27/2018 7:06 PM
I think that they could move their location to where it is easier to find for those who don’t know where it is and just make it more known to those who aren’t aware of it .
2/27/2018 7:02 PM
The care center should put themselves out there more, because not a lot of students know about it as much anymore. Hold an assembly with the peer counselors, to let students know they have a place to go.
2/27/2018 7:01 PM
Nothing.
2/27/2018 6:55 PM
I think it needs to advertise more and spread awareness. Personally I had no idea it existed until my friends began going.
2/27/2018 6:49 PM
Just keep it
2/27/2018 6:46 PM
The Care Center could make more signs to let students know that this is available to them on campus.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
maybe have some assemblies for them so people can just watch the videos mr gray makes and just let people be more aware that it’s there and that people can come at any time.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
Increase knowledge and visibility of the CARE center.
2/27/2018 6:43 PM
Have more peer counselors
2/27/2018 6:41 PM

2/27/2018 6:30 PM
i wish the hours were more accessible.
2/27/2018 6:29 PM
I don’t think they should improve anything. It is good how it is in my opinion
2/27/2018 6:23 PM
It's great
2/27/2018 6:07 PM
advertising or promoting the stuff they can help with and how
2/27/2018 6:06 PM
The amount of hours should increase
2/27/2018 5:45 PM
I do not believe there is something to fix.
2/27/2018 5:45 PM
Nothing
2/27/2018 5:43 PM
More advertising on what it is, where it is and why people should visit
2/27/2018 5:31 PM
I think what it already does for the community is absolutely wonderful.
2/27/2018 5:12 PM
nothing
2/27/2018 4:58 PM
It’s good as it is
2/27/2018 4:55 PM
I don’t know because I haven’t visited it.
2/27/2018 4:51 PM
I'm pretty content with how it is now
2/27/2018 4:50 PM
.
2/27/2018 4:45 PM
It could improve many of our mental health
2/27/2018 4:38 PM
i think the care center should be bigger
2/27/2018 4:37 PM
I wish there were more opportunity for students to go during classes, I know that the reason I’ve never gone is because I don’t want to miss class to do so. Maybe every now and then teachers could give their students one free pass if they were in the CARE center. If this isn’t possible though, I think just spreading awareness about when a student can visit the CARE center and how students can get the help they need at the CARE center itself would be nice. To be honest, I’m still a bit confused on how the CARE center operates and when students can/should go in.
2/27/2018 4:34 PM
It should be more loud on who they are and what they do
2/27/2018 4:19 PM
Nothing
2/27/2018 4:14 PM
Keep it here
2/27/2018 4:09 PM
Make sure everyone knows it is available and where it is
2/27/2018 4:06 PM
Advertise more! I don’t even know where it is
2/27/2018 4:05 PM
The amount of adult assistance.
2/27/2018 4:04 PM
Expanding to more schools
2/27/2018 3:56 PM
I think it is fine the way it is.
2/27/2018 3:56 PM
In letting more students know what they can help with
2/27/2018 3:53 PM
Putting themselves out there
2/27/2018 3:53 PM
Be fully funded by LBUSD and have two Mr. Grays there.
2/27/2018 3:50 PM
With a little more organization, including keeping track of students who come in and better checking up on them, the Care Center could be the ultimate mental health resource on campus. By also including ore tangible anxiety soothing resources- such as playdoh, a miniature zen sand garden, etc.- the Care Center may better be able to help students, especially when resources and councilors are stretched thin and students must wait. The Care Center needs MORE funding in order to ensure the safety and mental stability of students at Poly, not a defunding. In light of the tragic shootings nationwide as well as the tragedy suffered by Poly last year with Emilio Carreón, it is now more than ever we as a student body need the Care Center.
2/27/2018 3:18 PM
I think it is fine just the way it is. I think Wellness week has been a great success as well.
2/27/2018 2:26 PM
The care center is amazing as is, I just hope they spread the word more on saving it.
2/27/2018 2:22 PM
i think it’s fine the way it is
2/27/2018 2:20 PM
It doesn't have to improve, it's already amazing.
2/27/2018 1:48 PM
Checking in with people
2/27/2018 1:43 PM
for students to know it is a comfortable place to be than they think
2/27/2018 1:14 PM
More counselors

Reaching out more to the students

2/27/2018 12:05 PM
It could improve reaching people who don’t want help, but need it.
